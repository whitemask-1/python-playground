# AGENTS.md

## Mission

This repository is a Python playground for projects, experiments, tools, and explorations.
Agents should help build, debug, and improve code across the repo.

## Core Rules

1. Keep code clean, readable, and well-organized.
2. Follow the existing directory structure when adding new content.
3. Prefer simple solutions over over-engineered ones.
4. Explain non-obvious decisions or tricky logic when relevant.

## Directory Convention

- `projects/` - Standalone programs with their own subdirectory.
- `experiments/` - Library and framework explorations.
- `algorithms/` - Data structures, algorithms, and problem solving.
- `concepts/` - Python language reference and patterns.
- `tools/` - Small utility scripts.
- `sandbox/` - Ideas and scratch work.

## Code Style

- PEP8-compliant Python.
- Concise, readable code.
- Modular structure within projects.
- Comments only where the logic isn't self-evident.

## Safety and Privacy

- Do not expose secrets or personal data.
- Use `.env` files for API keys (never commit them).
- Keep generated data files out of version control.
