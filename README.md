# Python Playground

This repository serves as a personal learning journal documenting my journey of learning Python.

Rather than following isolated tutorials, this repo captures my understanding as it develops through:
- Small experiments and exploratory scripts
- Concept-focused exercises
- Mini-projects built to internalize core ideas
- Iterative refinements and refactors as knowledge improves

The goal is not perfection, but progression—using code as a medium to think, test, fail, and improve.
